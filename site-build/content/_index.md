### University of Bristol âˆ™ Research Computing Training

modifiedWelcome to this workshop on data visualisation using Streamlit. These pages can be followed in your own time, but also guide our training workshop.

In many areas of research and study, we want to be able to work with data, investigate what the data says through visualisation, and communicate our findings with others. Streamlit ties these all together, providing a clear way to write code, present interactive analysis, and publish it on the internet.
